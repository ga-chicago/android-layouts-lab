Practice creating layouts &amp; Views with popular layout designs!

## The Goal

You'll pick five layouts from the following list. For each item in the list that you pick (sounds like looping through an array, right?) you will create an individual XML layout in an Android project and mock the layout provided. These do not need to be perfect. If you're unfamiliar with what a layout would look like, download the app and take a peek. Each layout is designed to be re-used; you do not need to make multiples of the same one.

>> _Create a layout_ by right clicking (ctrl-click) on the solution explorer, select **New**, and select **Layout**.

## The Result

You'll include each layout in your **MainActivity**. You can do this using the `<include>` element:

```xml
<include
android:layout_width="fill_parent"
android:layout_height="wrap_content"
layout="@layout/yourlayout" />
```

>> _Reminder_: Each Android view requires a **layout_width** and a **layout_height**.
